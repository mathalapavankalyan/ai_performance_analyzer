# 🧠 AI Performance Analyzer

### 🚀 Overview  
**AI Performance Analyzer** is a full-stack performance monitoring and analytics platform built with **Python (FastAPI)** and **React**.  
It continuously collects and analyzes application logs to provide **real-time, AI-driven insights** about your system’s behavior, performance, and reliability.

Instead of manually checking thousands of log lines, developers can simply ask the integrated assistant questions such as:  
> “Which API is taking the longest?”  
> “Which page is being accessed the most?”  
> “Are there any APIs failing frequently?”

The project is divided into two main components:
- **AI Analyzer** – A FastAPI backend that handles log ingestion, AI-based analysis, and insight generation.  
- **Blog App** – A React frontend that visualizes performance metrics and includes a chatbot assistant for developer interaction.
